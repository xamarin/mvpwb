# TinyRenderer

These workbooks are a port of an excellent [C++ series](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki) written by Dmitry Sokolov.
We appreciate that original work is available under a license that allowed us to turn it into a Workbook.

Hopefully, you will find it as fascinating and educational as we did.
